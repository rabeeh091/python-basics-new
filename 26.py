#Slicing Strings

#you can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

#Specify the start index and the end index,
#separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

#get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not include)?

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5]) # stop index is not added

# the first character has index 0.
